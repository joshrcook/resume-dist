I helped build and maintain high-traffic websites and landing pages for these brands, and was constantly implementing A/B tests to help them perform even better.</p> <p>I also managed multiple teams of junior and mid-level developers during my time here to drive the technical direction for the team as well as mentoring and coaching each team member. I collaborated with business teams and designers to create excellent experiences within the constraints of limited resources and time.</p> <p>I was also able to mentor new developers through a company-run non-profit, as well as through an internal tech academy set up to help non-developers make the transition to a front-end developer. My contribution there helped several people go from having no experience in development to getting full-time jobs as front-end developers.</p> </div> </div> <div class="work-item uk-child-width-1-2@m  uk-margin-large-bottom" uk-grid=""> <div> <strong class="work-item__title"><a href="http://elevationchurch.org/" target="_blank">Elevation Church</a></strong><br> <em>Lead Developer<br>May 2015 - Apr 2016</em> </div> <div> <p>Developed, deployed and maintained several large-scale responsive websites including <a href="http://elevationchurch.org" target="_blank">elevationchurch.org</a> and <a href="https://stevenfurtick.com" target="_blank">stevenfurtick.com</a> including both front-end and back-end coding.

At work, I have fun and always keep a positive, upbeat attitude. I enjoy working within a team and strive to always make the team better.</p> <p>Outside of work, I have a wife and 3 very awesome kids. I spend my weekends hiking, doing DIY home improvement projects, and picking on my acoustic guitar. My wife and I also really enjoy traveling together, and it's our dream to own our own RV one day.</p> <p>I believe that the biggest mountains can only be climbed as part of a team, and one of the greatest things you can do once you learn something is to help someone else improve as well. I love making other people better and helping them succeed.</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="uk-section uk-section-large" id="contact" d="" data-body-class="color-scheme--4"> <div class="uk-container"> <h2 class="uk-h2 uk-margin-large-bottom">This is just a website.
